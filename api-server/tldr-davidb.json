{ "text" :  "During my time at Waikato I have broadened my interest in digital media, while retaining a particular emphasis on music. In particular, my research focuses on the boundary between algorithmic content analysis—which is inevitably error-prone—and human computer interaction in on-line information systems. It's all very well having an algorithm that can detect transitions between someone speaking and music playing in an audio file with 98.7% accuracy, for instance, but given that error rate how can an information system make use of this in a practical way that helps a user? How can information systems be designed to allow user corrections of such errors, and how does this user feedback relate back to the underlying algorithm used?" }
