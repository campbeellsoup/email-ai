For James,
used wget to download jar files -- remember to click one page further to get to the real URL

For now we are using the previous 'stable' release.  This is because the newer release had a
broken link for the "Binary (ZIP Format) for Spring wiring"

It is the Spring wiring download that has the ./bin/james program in it.

For a port scan:

   sudo nmap -p0-1024 localhsot

  sudo systemctl stop exim4
  

Currently in the 'previous-version' directory in /home/aimail/


To run it:

  sudo ./bin/james start
